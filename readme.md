# CELLAR LIBRARY - GÃ¶nninger B&T's Common Lisp Foundation Library

## NOTE:  June 3, 2017 - This contains pre-release X.01.00 of Cellar version A.01.00.

## What Is This?
CELLAR is a set of classes, methods and functions in the Common Lisp language. The library is the foundation of all GBT Common Lisp applications.

It provides (not a complete list):

* A base class that ensures each instance gets associated a UUID
* A logging mechanism based on Log4CL
* Most of the functions described in the book On Lisp by Paul Graham
* An implementation of Finite State Machines

and much more ;-) - you are invited to explore ...

## Latest Release
The upcoming release is [TRIANGULUM - CELLAR X.01.00](https://github.com/dg1sbg/cellar/releases/tag/CELLAR_PREREL_X0100). See the planned [changes](https://github.com/dg1sbg/cellar/milestone/1) for this release.

## Required Common Lisp Packages
CELLAR builds on the following Common Lisp packages:

* [bordeaux-threads](https://common-lisp.net/project/bordeaux-threads/)
* [closer mop](https://common-lisp.net/project/closer/)
* [alexandria](https://common-lisp.net/project/alexandria/)
* [babel](https://common-lisp.net/project/babel/)
* [net.telent.date](http://www.cliki.net/net-telent-date)
* [uuid](http://www.cliki.net/uuid)
* [uiop](http://www.cliki.net/uiop)
* [trivial-backtrace](http://www.cliki.net/trivial-backtrace)
* [cells](https://github.com/kennytilton/cells/wiki)
* [log4cl](https://github.com/7max/log4cl)

All of them a loadable via [quicklisp](https://www.quicklisp.org/).

## Reporting Problems
Generally you can report problems in two fashions, either by [opening an issue ticket](https://github.com/dg1sbg/cellar/issues/new) or by [emailing to CELLAR support](cellar-support@goenninger.net). In both cases, though, you should have the following pieces handy in order for us to be able to help you out as quickly and painlessly as possible:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Your Common Lisp implementation name and version.
* The branch of CELLAR that you're using.
* A paste of the build log or failure point that you reached.
* Patience.
